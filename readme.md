# Botkit Cards

A simple application for testing the [adaptive cards samples](https://adaptivecards.io/samples/) with Webex Teams. 

This project is based on the Botkit starter kit for Webex and was created with the [Yeoman generator](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/tree/master/packages/generator-botkit#readme).

To complete the configuration of this bot, make sure to update the included `.env` file with your platform tokens and credentials.  See the `.env.sample` file for an example.  Also refer to the [Botkit Docs](https://botkit.ai/docs/v4).
